# Clinical-Bioinformatics Project
The analysis of miRNA expression profiling between Parkinson’s & Alzheimer’s diseases.

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's & Alzheimer's diseases are broad-spectrum diseases. Therefore, the phenotypical overlap between these two diseases make clinical diagnosis challenging resulting in the prescription of treatment equally challenging. Molecular mechanisms in each patient is different due to the nature of DNA makeups and mRNA transcription. Therefore, it is quite important to detect the most important genes and MicroRNAs(miRNA), a group of small, noncoding RNAs, in association with molecular events common to Parkinson's or Alzheimer's diseases to clearly differentiate them.

<b> <br>Objective:</br> </b>
Profiling of expression of overlapped miRNA in Parkinson's  Disease and  Alzheimer's Diseases to study disease spectrum overlap to inform the development of personalised medicines.

<b> <br> Hypothesis:</br> </b> 
Profiling of expression of overlapped miRNA in Parkinson's  Disease and  Alzheimer's Diseases to study disease spectrum overlap to inform the development of personalised medicines.

<br> I have created my own workflow in this analysis.</br>

Briefly, I used the Cytoscape app, algorithm RWRMTN and miRNet was used in this analysis. The RWRMTN was used in this project for predicting disease-associated microRNA (miRNA) based.  This method was based on a random walk framework, random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm on the miRNA-target interaction network to rank candidate miRNAs. Therefore, this algorithm mimics a walker that moves from a current node in a network. The full mathematical algorithm was explained in this  <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-03578-3">article</a>. The results were validated using literature and publically available databases.
