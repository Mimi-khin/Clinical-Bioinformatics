The analysis of miRNA expression profiling between Parkinson’s & Alzheimer’s diseases.

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's & Alzheimer's diseases are broad-spectrum diseases. Therefore, the phenotypical overlap between these two diseases make clinical diagnosis challenging resulting in the prescription of treatment equally challenging. Molecular mechanisms in each patient is different due to the nature of DNA makeups and mRNA transcription. Therefore, it is quite important to detect the most important genes and MicroRNAs(miRNA), a group of small, noncoding RNAs, in association with molecular events common to Parkinson's or Alzheimer's diseases to clearly differentiate them.

<b> <br>Objective:</br> </b>
Profiling of expression of overlapped miRNA in Parkinson's  Disease and  Alzheimer's Diseases to study disease spectrum overlap to inform the development of personalised medicines.

<b> <br> Hypothesis:</br> </b> 
Profiling of expression of overlapped miRNA in Parkinson's  Disease and  Alzheimer's Diseases to study disease spectrum overlap to inform the development of personalised medicines.

<br> I have created my own workflow in this analysis.
